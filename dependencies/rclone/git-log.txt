    This sentence was written at the time when backend used access token, nowadays, users need to generate and use application password instead, see #6398.

    box: fix reconnect failing with HTTP 400 Bad Request
    
    The error is:
    
      Error: failed to configure token with jwt authentication: jwtutil: failed making auth request: 400 Bad Request
    
    With the following additional debug information:
    
      jwtutil: Response Body: {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"Please check the 'aud' claim. Should be a string"}
    
    Problem is that in jwt-go the RegisteredClaims type has Audience field (aud claim) that
    is a list, while box apparantly expects it to be a singular string. In jwt-go v4 we
    currently use there is an alternative type StandardClaims which matches what box wants.
    Unfortunately StandardClaims is marked as deprecated, and is removed in the
    newer v5 version, so we this is a short term fix only.
    
    Fixes #7114

    operations: fix .rclonelink files not being converted back to symlinks
    
    Before this change the new partial downloads code was causing symlinks
    to be copied as regular files.
    
    This was because the partial isn't named .rclonelink so the local
    backend saves it as a normal file and renaming it to .rclonelink
    doesn't cause it to become a symlink.
    
    This fixes the problem by not copying .rclonelink files using the
    partials mechanism but reverting to the previous --inplace behaviour.
    
    This could potentially be fixed better in the future by changing the
    local backend Move to change files to and from symlinks depending on
    their name. However this was deemed too complicated for a point
    release.
    
    This also adds a test in the local backend. This test should ideally
    be in operations but it isn't easy to put it there as operations knows
    nothing of symlinks.
    
    Fixes #7101

    local: fix partial directory read for corrupted filesystem
    
    Before this change if a directory entry could be listed but not
    lstat-ed then rclone would give an error and abort the directory
    listing with the error
    
        failed to read directory entry: failed to read directory "XXX": lstat XXX
    
    This change makes sure that the directory listing carries on even
    after this kind of error.
    
    The sync will be failed but it will carry on.
    
    This problem was caused by a programming error setting the err
    variable in an outer scope when it should have been using a local err
    variable.

    smb: fix "Statfs failed: bucket or container name is needed" when mounting
    
    Before this change, if you mounted the root of the smb then it would
    give an error on rclone about and periodically in the mount logs:
    
        Statfs failed: bucket or container name is needed in remote
    
    This fix makes the smb backend return empty usage in this case which
    will stop the errors and show the default 1P of free space.

    webdav: nextcloud: fix must use /dav/files/USER endpoint not /webdav error
    
    Fix https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7103
    
    Before this change the RegExp validating the endpoint URL was a bit
    too strict allowing only /dav/files/USER due to chunking limitations.
    
    This patch adds back support for /dav/files/USER/dir/subdir etc.

    operations: fix deadlock when using lsd/ls with --progress - Fixes #7102
    
    The --progress flag overrides operations.SyncPrintf in order to do its
    magic on stdout without interfering with other output.
    
    Before this change the syncFprintf routine in operations (which is
    used to print all output to stdout) was taking the
    operations.StdoutMutex and the printProgress function in the
    --progress routine was also attempting to take the same mutex causing
    a deadlock.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by moving the locking from the
    syncFprintf function to SyncPrintf. It is then up to the function
    overriding this to lock the StdoutMutex. This ensures the StdoutMutex
    can never cause a deadlock.

    dirtree: fix performance with large directories of directories and --fast-list
    
    Before this change if using --fast-list on a directory with more than
    a few thousand directories in it DirTree.CheckParents became very slow
    taking up to 24 hours for a directory with 1,000,000 directories in
    it.
    
    This is because it becomes an O(NÂ²) operation as DirTree.Find has to
    search each directory in a linear fashion as it is stored as a slice.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by scanning the DirTree for directories
    before starting the CheckParents process so it never has to call
    DirTree.Find.
    
    After the fix calling DirTree.CheckParents on a directory with
    1,000,000 directories in it will take about 1 second.
    
    Anything which calls DirTree.Find can potentially have bad performance
    so in the future we should redesign the DirTree to use a different
    underlying datastructure or have an index.

    docs: fixed typo in exclude example in filtering docs (#7097)
    
    The exclude flag instructions had "without" written as "with" which changes the whole meaning of how the exclude flag works.
